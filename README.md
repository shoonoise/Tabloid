Tabloid
=======

Makes pretty table in console.


Requirements and dependencies
----------
 - `python 3.*`.

 - [Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) needs to color header.

Example
-------
If you run [`example.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shoonoise/Tabloid/master/example.py) as is, you should see something like (depends on terminal's color scheme):

Why not ${YOUR_FAV_LIB}?
-------

Well, at first, existing libs does not tolerant to ~big data~ long lines. And it's enough for me.
But, as I've started to write my own lib, I try to add something more.
So, you can define formatting rules for each cell based on column, row or moon size.
